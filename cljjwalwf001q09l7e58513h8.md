I started my career in 2015. I have tried several ways to track my expenses. I have invested in multiple investment options. In this blog post, I want to share the learnings of my personal finance journey so far.

# Tracking Expenses

In 2015, I used [walnut (now axios)](https://axio.co.in/walnut/) app to track my expenses. I used to track each and every penny using the app. From net banking, credit card, debit card, and cash transactions, everything I used to track. At that time, I didn't think about investments much. It also helped me in reminding myself about the bills. But, at that time, I didn't concerned about my data privacy. I didn't know that I am giving permission to read all my SMS'es and transactional data.

Later, in 2020, I created a spreadsheet to enter the data in a summary format, to get a clear picture. Today, I realized that I should have simply exported the data from Walnut and simply put it in the spreadsheet.

Later in 2021, I improved the template to a better version. But, still, the manual process of entering from Walnut into the spreadsheet still exists.

Later in 2022, I stopped using Walnut, since I moved to iPhone. I used to download bank statements, introspect them and enter them into the report. Until October 2022, I used to micro-manage the expenses a lot. I used to enter a single rupee into the reports to know the cash-in and cash-out flows. But, I moved to a macro-management approach of tracking only major expenses and budgeting my salary into expenses and investments. So, when I budget 50,000 as living expenses, I only look at how much is remaining at the month's end.

**The approach of macro-management and budgeting worked for me. It reduced my time to manage my finances and also gave the control over it.**

Here's the budget template I use - [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/107jTWsyzDal5dUOaaP8rXidnaolxMn0WzVgKuCIYzME/edit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/107jTWsyzDal5dUOaaP8rXidnaolxMn0WzVgKuCIYzME/edit)

# Investments

In 2015, I initially started my investment journey with chit funds. I didn't have much control over the finances. My uncle asked me to invest in a chit fund and he rotated that money for interest. I faced a lot of month-end crunches due to it. I had to depend on credit cards, loans from friends, etc...

In 2018, my other uncle suggested investing in secure chit funds and said that there will be more returns in it. At that time, I didn't research about it. I didn't even care how chit funds work and how we make money. In 2020, I researched them and realized that people who organize chit-funds are the ones who make a lot of money. There is a very high risk involved in it even though they are private limited companies. Also, another problem is it is very hard to redeem them. When I call for redemption in an auction, I was asked to submit a blank cheque or property documents as a guarantee for it.

In 2021, I moved away from chit funds and started investing in mutual funds for the long-term and short-term. I used [goalwise (now niyomoney)](https://niyomoney.com) for all mutual fund investments. I followed their recommendations for my investments. I also invest in stocks via [zerodha](https://kite.zerodha.com/) and used [smallcase](https://smallcase.com) for the recommendations and rebalances. I also invest a good amount of money in physical gold every year.
