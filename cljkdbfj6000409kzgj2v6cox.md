For the year of April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2023, Here are the mutual funds I selected for different goals.

# Short Term Goals

I prepared an Excel sheet of mutual funds and their returns. For the short-term goals which range from 1-3 years, I chose [Sundaram Equity Savings Direct - Growth](https://www.valueresearchonline.com/funds/1306/sundaram-equity-savings-fund/) since it is performing well in the same category, the expense ratio is less and the ratings are good. Also, the reason why I chose the hybrid mutual fund category is that they invest 65% of the money into equity and equity arbitrage and 35% into debt so that the returns would be fair.

In the category of short-term mutual funds, I selected UTI mainly because the historical returns are very good even though the ratings are not good.

# Emergency Fund

For emergency funds, it is a no-brainer to go with liquid funds. So, I selected the below 3 for it. Out of these, two funds are recommended by NiyoMoney because they provide instant redemption option, so I kept them as is but added Quant Liquid fund for its historical performance.

# Long Term Goals

For long-term goals which are greater than 5 years, I simply had chosen the index funds. One reason is in the long run, index funds give good returns over any other active funds. They also have a very low expense ratio. Also, there is no headache of rebalancing, taxes computation, etc... [NiyoMoney had recommended](https://www.niyomoney.com/blog/the-2022-list-of-recommended-mutual-funds-on-niyo-money/) the same, so I simply went with them.

# Tax Saving Goals

## Health Insurance

Under Section 80D, we can get deductions of 50,000 for the health insurance of parents and self-family. I bought [HDFC ergo optima secure health insurance](https://www.hdfcergo.com/docs/default-source/downloads/brochures/optima-secure-brochure.pdf) for 50,000 and claimed it as an income tax deduction.

## NPS

Very few people know that over and above the 80C limit of 1,50,000 we can get more exemptions. Under 80CCD(1B), the employee contributions to NPS are exempted up to Rs. 50,000 per year. Also under 80CCD(2), the employer contributions (up to 10% of basic pay) are exempted over and above.

## Term Insurance, ELSS mutual funds, SSY

I have taken a term insurance which I pay 2700 per month and I invest 4000 every month in ELSS mutual funds. I also invest in SSY for my daughter 6000 every month. All of this constitutes to 1,50,000 which is 80C limit. We also have EPF contributions by employer which comes under 80C.
