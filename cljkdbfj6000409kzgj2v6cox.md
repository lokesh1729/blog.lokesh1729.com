For the year of April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2023, Here are the mutual funds I selected for different goals.

# Short Term Goals

I prepared an Excel sheet of mutual funds and their returns. For the short-term goals which range from 1-3 years, I chose [Sundaram Equity Savings Direct - Growth](https://www.valueresearchonline.com/funds/1306/sundaram-equity-savings-fund/) since it is performing well in the same category, the expense ratio is less and the ratings are good. Also, the reason why I chose the hybrid mutual fund category is that they invest 65% of the money into equity and equity arbitrage and 35% into debt so that the returns would be fair.

In the category of short-term mutual funds, I selected UTI mainly because the historical returns are very good even though the ratings are not good.

# Emergency Fund

For emergency funds, it is a no-brainer to go with liquid funds. So, I selected the below 3 for it. Out of these, two funds are recommended by NiyoMoney because they provide instant redemption option, so I kept them as is but added Quant Liquid fund for its historical performance.

# Long Term Goals

For long-term goals which are greater than 5 years, I simply had chosen the index funds. One reason is in the long run, index funds give good returns over any other active funds. They also have a very low expense ratio. Also, there is no headache of rebalancing, taxes computation, etc... [NiyoMoney had recommended](https://www.niyomoney.com/blog/the-2022-list-of-recommended-mutual-funds-on-niyo-money/) the same, so I simply went with them.
