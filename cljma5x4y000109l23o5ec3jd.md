In this blog post, I want to share the investment options I choose for the financial year FY2023-24.

# Emergency Fund

Earlier, I invested in liquid funds for an emergency fund, despite they have given the instant redemption feature the returns are very low. So, for this year, I want to go for money market funds because they are offering good returns and I don't want an instant redemption feature.

I have shortlisted only two funds. Even though nippon has 5-star ratings from both agencies, the risk is moderate according to ValueResearch. So, I went ahead with "Tata Money Market Fund".

# Short Term Goals

For short-term goals (1-3 years), I decided to use recurring deposits than debt mutual funds because, from this financial year, [the government has removed the indexation benefit for debt mutual funds](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Findianexpress.com%2Farticle%2Fbusiness%2Fmarket%2Findexation-benefits-debt-mutual-funds-stand-out-against-fixed-deposits-8535261%2F) which means that they are taxed as income under the same tax slab. So, there is no difference between RD and debt mutual funds. I did some research and found that Equitas is giving a [whooping 8.2% interest for RDs](https://www.equitasbank.com/sites/default/files/inline-files/domestic-recurring-deposit-rate.pdf). When it comes to security, the DICGC insures principal and interest up to a maximum amount of five lakhs. So, not to worry about it.

For other short-term goals like vacation, I selected Kotak Savings Fund because it is rated 5 stars by morning star and NiyoMoney also recommends it.

# Long Term Goals

For long-term goals, I have been investing in index funds for the past 2 years for so many good reasons. So, for this year too, I will be going [ahead with NiyoMoney recommendations](https://www.niyomoney.com/blog/2023-mutual-fund-recommendations-2/).

Apart from the index funds, I also started investing in equity active funds since last year. So, I am continuing the same this year but wanted to add a midcap fund to the portfolio. Hence, I selected Quant Midcap. Even though Motilal Oswal is giving good returns, there is negative rating in Morningstar.
